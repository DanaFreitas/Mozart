      Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is a name that many have heard in their lives,
      from the common person through popular culture to musicians who look to
      him for inspiration. Here, in the Mozart fan club, we would like to show
      our appreciation for him through informing the world of his actions and
      staying connected on updates about him and his music.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      His legendary life began with his birth in Salzburg Austria in 1756. He
      was a prodigy from a young age, playing the keyboard from the age of three
      and having an innate ear for music and harmony. His father, a composer and
      musician himself, nurtured his abilities, and by the age of 5, he had been
      writing compositions himself, now known as his “early works”. Those around
      him were astonished that much a young child was able to make such amazing
      works. However, this would only be the beginning of his career, where he
      would only reach greater heights from there.

    />

    <p class="paragraph">
      When he was young, his family traveled throughout Europe, where he
      showcased his talents. Everywhere, he would play a great variety of styles
      and a variety of instruments, ranging from the harpsicord to the violin.
      Many saw him as a child prodigy or “wunderkind” that he was. By the age of
      12, he would write his first opera, “La finta semplice”, an amazing
      achievement for anyone, at any age, even as he had health and financial
      issues. Nevertheless, his early works were the beginning of his greatness
      blossoming.

    />

    <p class="paragraph">
      As he grew older, his musical ability would only grow, with him growing a
      network of patrons, musicians, and artists, leading to collaborations
      including “The Marriage of Figaro”, “Don Giovanni”, and “The Magic Flute,”
      that are still remembered today.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Sadly, his life had not been without challenges. As with his youth, even
      with his success, he has financial difficulties. This would be compounded
      by his health, as he suffered from medical issues that doctors at the time
      would not be able to handle.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      On the 5th of December 1791, in Vienna, his life ended at the age of 35.
      He left the world short of one of the greatest composers it has ever seen,
      countless works, snuffed out before they could have ever come to life.
